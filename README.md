# X68000CPUADAPTER-PISTORM

This simple adapter allows to use a 68000 DIP CPU standard into a X68000 machine. The measures has been taked on a Ace machine. It has been designed specially to use with the PISTORM board (Claude's Schwarz design).

### Note: 

This will electronically work with PISTORM but firmware needs some work and is not ready yet. Do not stalk Claude's or other developers, give people some time to test it.
